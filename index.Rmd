###About
How are the effects of environmental exposures transmitted across generations to impact the health of children? I employ methods in epidemiology, genomics, epigenetics, and molecular biology to answer this question.

Before starting this work at Columbia, I received a BA/MA degree in Biology from Wesleyan University, where I researched the evolutionary implications of heritable, environmentally induced epigenetic changes in plants. [I showed that plant's may respond to a source of environmental stress by modifying their offspring in specific ways that increase evolutionary fitness under that stress.](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rstb.2018.0182) Moreover, [environmentally induced DNA methylation changes were shown to medaite these changes in offspring development.](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2018.01251/full)
